I study computer science with the minor subject economics at the Technical Univeristy Dortmund in Germany.
One area in computer science I am most interested in is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks and AI.
Other areas are Web Development and Server Administration.
I have experience in deploying and managing my own personal GNU/Linux servers,
having experience with multiple server/client technologies which include: Spring, Django,..
I have at some point used quite a lot of GNU/Linux  distributions from binary to source based.
Operating systems like Qubes OS give me hope regarding security issues and mass surveillance.
